List of changes from GEOFON distribution (G. Helffrich/U. Bristol)

mkconf/Make.Linux.FLAGS

  Add FFLAGS for Fortran compilation, FC file in top-level directory
  for name of Fortran compiler (g77 or f77 as appropriate).

src/C/C_functions.c

  Encode times internally used for file searching logic to use fewer
  significant figures.  Former format caused numerical overflows and
  invalid time comparisions under Red Hat 4.2 Linux with gcc 2.7.2.

  get_sfile:
    Remove unconditional call to exit(1)

  ExtractTime:
    Use new time format; pad to 14 characters.

  julday:
    New function
  
  ToLongTime:
    Use new time format.  This function appears to be unused in the present
    version of the subroutine package.
  
  ToLongDouble:
    Return new time format

  ToStd:
    New function to convert time in seconds since 1 Jan, 1970 to new
    time format.
  
  FromStd:
    New function to return in seconds since 1 Jan, 1970 given new time format.

  TestTime:
    Debugging output to conditional compilation.

src/Fortran/copy_seed.f

  Make into directly-compied Fortran code; conditional compilation logic
  turned into executable code via swap variable value.

  Violation of Fortran standard in 5 instances:  reads into variable used
  as DO loop control variable.

  Stuttering of 'copy_seed' greeting with wrong version number when
  usage printed out.

src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.F

  extr_diff:
    get_diff function doesn't properly byte swap Steim 1 data format;
    use equivalence logic to swap 2 and 4 byte quantities.  Note that
    shift logic in get_diff does *not* properly work right on little-endian
    machines.

  swap_mseed:
    set wordord = 1 in data blockettes when converting to Sun format
    (ind=-1)

  byteorder:
    new function to return SEED definition of byte order of machine
    on which subroutine is run (used by copy_seed for swap logic).

src/Fortran/Make.Linux.FLib

  Finer control on debug flags, use $(FC) variable for Fortran compiler
  name.

src/Fortran/Make.Linux.Targets

  Finer control on debug flags, use $(FC) to link Fortran-compiled
  executables.  Add new target make_qseed, also make copy_seed.f a
  Fortran program to facilitate debugging with gdb.

src/Fortran/make_qseed.f

  Updated for use with PASSCAL version 1.9 programs.  These produce
  mseed blockettes of 4096 byte size.

  Make into Fortran program (.f suffix).

  Add option -s to revert to 1024 byte blockettes.

  Change channel naming logic: > 20sps H, < 10 sps L, otherwise B

  Remove tab characters in format statements (invalid Fortran)

src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f

  dec_fixhdr, dec_fixhdr_ful:
    If time correction was applied to header date, then timcor is
    zero.  This is to be consistent with behavior of all def_fixhdr*
    routines which unconditionally set the Activity flags in mseed header
    to zero, meaning the time correction was *not* applied.
    ***NOTE*** Disadvantage of this change is that record of time correction
    is lost.

  fill_real:
    simplify logic and fix bug that zeroed all digits of exact power-of-10
    numbers.

src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f
  parse_seed_db:
    Explicit checks for table overflow and report errors.
    Expand a number of tables.

src/Fortran/copy_seed.f
  copy_seed:
    Add debug options

src/Fortran/cre_seed_head_sub.f
  write_resp_coeff:
    Handle case of incredibly long type 54 FIR coefficient blockettes.  Split
    them into overflow blockettes on subsequent SEED volume blocks.

    Add debug output activated by main program.

  cre_seed_head:
    If no time spans provided, and no start/end time given for seed volume
    creation, invent default.  Otherwise use start/end times provided.

    Fix bug when dataless volumes being written: only first station header
    written.

src/Fortran/dlsv.f
  main:
    Use network duration for validity extent of seed volume.

    Optionally keep files when finished, but delete by default.

    Parse for debugging options.

    Provide explicit volume label option.

2005 25 Jan./GRH
src/include/head_seed.inc:
    Widen strings for station start/end times in database.

src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
    Parse times with hour minute second fields, too.
    Make parse_time into a subroutine, not a function.

src/Fortran/copy_seed.f, .../make_dlsv.f, .../cre_seed_head_sub.f:
    change function to subroutine calls for parse_time

2006 8 June/GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f, copy_seed.f:
    Handle reblocking of smaller blocks into 4096 byte blocks (Nanometrics
    data).
    Change calling sequence for extr_diffs; re-code get_nibble.
    Fix bug in make_4096 which caused it not to save jbuf buffer across
    routine calls.

2006 18 Nov./GRH
src/Fortran/check_seed.f:
    Fix bug in option processing.  Did not handle -B option properly.
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
    Fix bug in option processing.  Did not handle the last argument
    correctly and didn't assign it to the ' ' (blank) option.

2006 19 Nov./GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed.f:
    Check for provision of mandatory options.
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
    Fix bug in handling of one station networks.  Did not add station to search
    list.

2006 29 Nov./GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed.f:
    Add time trace option (not complete, but a start).
    Track first and last samples in Steim buffers so decompression checks can
    be made.
    Fix formatting of 'End of input volume:' message.
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
    Fix logic for doing byte swapping on little-endian machines.

2007 02 Feb./GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
    Fix punctuation of time items in fill_time when mode=2.

2007 29 Jul./GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
    Fix code to byte-swap mseed header values.  (I can't believe that I am still
    fixing bugs of this type -- it has been 10 years so far.)

src/Fortran/make_qseed.f:
    Add -n, -r, -o options; report endianness of input data.  Change naming
    options to SEED default rates (H, B, M, L).

2007 5 Sep./GRH
src/Fortran/{copy_seed_sub.f,copy_seed.f}:
    Fix (again!) code to byte-swap mseed header values.  This version will
    use a database of mixed-endian mseed, and will always write big-endian
    mseed as the output volume.

    Make i4swap into a subroutine from a function.

2007 7 Sep./GRH
src/Fortran/make_qseed.f:
    Add sample rate to output; fix endianness reporting.  Fix re-blocking code
    to work with little-endian data in archives.

    Fix bug in swap back to big-endian (swap type -1).
ToolsLib/avldelete.c:
    Fix function declarations to prevent newer gccs from complaining.

2010 6 Oct./GRH
src/Fortran/make_qseed.f:
    Add flag to set explicit sample rate (-s x) to recover from corrupted data
    blocks.

    decide whether to do Steim sample count checks.

2014 30 Dec./GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
  parse_seed_db:
    If reading response file and no SEED_STUFF_HOME given, look in current
    directory.

2015 6 Jan./GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
  get_sub_string:
    Fix logic assuming exactly one blank between strings.  Absolutely
    unbelievable coding flaw.

2018 24 Aug./GRH
src/Fortran/check_seed.f:
  -a option without block didn't work; fixed check for following digit string.
  Updated -a option to repair sample count and xN value in Steim-1 frames.

2018 10 Sep./GRH
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
  (dec_fixhead): Fix heuristics to detect byte swapped header based on date
  range.  Wrong verdict if last day in leap year.

2018 18 Sep./GRH
src/Fortran/check_seed.f, src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
  (main): Accept records with DRQMB tags as equivalent to D.
  (dec_fixhead, dec_fixhead_full): ditto.

2018 21 Sep./GRH
src/Fortran/check_seed.f:
  (main): Don't complain about sample checks on STEIM-2 data.
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
  (dec_fixhead): handle 1000 not first blockette
  (dec_fixhed_ful): ditto

2019 31 Jan./GRH
src/Fortran/make_qseed.f:
   (main): Trust the sample count in each blocktte header unless -R is set.
   Led to junk at end of Steim data to be included if the Steim control words
   were not zeroed but the sample count in the blockette was right.

2019 02 Aug./GRH
src/include/head_seed.inc:
   Make no_denom into an array.
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
   (write_resp_coeff): Write zero denom count at end of coefficients in any
   overflow blockette 54.
   (cre_head_seed): Trace gain at every stage under -t h option.
   (parse_seed_db): Use no_denom(i)
src/Fortran/cre_seed_head_sub.f:
   (write_coeff_abbr): Use no_denom(i)

2019 03 Aug./GRH
src/Fortran/make_dlsv.f:  Don't overwrite dataless.seed because block SEED i/o
   will not truncate the output file and junk may be left at the end of a
   previous dataless SEED.  Warn and say to remove before re-running.

2023 30 Jan./GRH
configure.ac:
   Fix problems with -m32 OK for C but not Fortran.  Add -std=legacy to
   Fortran compile flags to prevent bogus compile errors.
ToolsLib/*.c:
   Fix various gripes about compilation warnings.

2023 31 Jan./GRH

   Add field for digitizer analog response.
src/Fortran/copy_seed_sub.f:
   (parse_seed_db): Parse analog digitizer response.
src/Fortran/cre_seed_head_sub.f:
   (cre_head_seed): Write out analog digitizer response if present.
